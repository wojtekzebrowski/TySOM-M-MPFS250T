# Linux for TySOM-M-MPFS250T
This directory contains TySOM-M-MPFS250T Yocto Project layer. In order to build Linux the PolarFire SoC repository must be downloaded

## Table of Content

2. [Building Linux OS](#building_linux)
3. [Running Linux OS on the TySOM-M-MPFS250T](#running_linux)

## 1. Prepare repository <a name="prepare_repo"/>
a). "repo" tool installation
- Go to the directory where you keep utilities and make sure it's in your PATH
```bash
 $ cd ~/bin/
```
- Download the repo script
```bash
 $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
```
- Make repo executable
```bash
 $ chmod a+x repo
```
- Test repo is working
```bash
 $ repo --help
```

b). Download PolarFire SoC repository
- change directory to the yocto directory in Aldec TySOM-M-MPFS250T repository
- initialize repo, synchronize it and rebase
```bash
$ repo init -u https://github.com/polarfire-soc/meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp.git -b refs/tags/v2021.04 -m tools/manifests/riscv-yocto.xml
$ repo sync
$ repo rebase
```
- [OPTIONAL] For older OS, prepare build tools in proper version e.g. tar 3.x and gcc 10.x
```bash
$ cd ./openembedded-core/scripts
$ ./install-buildtools --with-extended-buildtools --url http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-3.0.2/
```

c). Environment setting
- [OPTIONAL] If you have downloaded the optional tools for older OS in point b) then source it:
```bash
$ source ../openembedded-core/buildtools/environment-setup-x86_64-pokysdk-linux
```
- Source PolarFire Yocto project setup script
```bash
$ source ./meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/polarfire-soc_yocto_setup.sh
```

d). Add meta_TySOM-M-MPFS250T_yocto_bsp layer
- go to build directory and add the layer using below command:
```bash
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta_TySOM-M-MPFS250T_yocto_bsp
```

## 2. Building Linux OS <a name="building_linux"/>
a). In order to build Linux the environment should be set (Point 1.c Environment setting).
b). After point 1.c you should be in the build directory. Bitbake Linux files:
```bash
$ MACHINE=tysom-m-mpfs250t bitbake mpfs-dev-cli
```
After successfull build the Yocto Project Image and Binaries will be available in:
```bash
build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/tysom-m-mpfs250t
```

## 3. Running Linux OS on the TySOM-M-MPFS250T <a name="running_linux"/>
To be able to boot Linux OS the TySOM-M-MPFS250T, the board must be programmed with a bitfile and HSS application. Linux OS can be loaded form eMMC memory or from SD card, but not at the same time. Please use the bitfile and HSS for the desired mode (More information can be found in the reference_design directory in this repository)

a) Preparing SD Card  (Host PC with Linux OS)
- insert SD Card into SD card reader and connect it to your workstation
- check with dmesg command the label of the SD card and use it in the below command instead of **sdX**
```bash
zcat ./tmp-glibc/deploy/images/tysom-m-mpfs250t/mpfs-dev-cli-tysom-m-mpfs250t.wic.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 iflag=fullblock oflag=direct conv=fsync status=progress
```
- when the command is complete plug the SD card into the TySOM-M-MPFS250T board, connect PMOD-UART and power on the board. The Linux console should be visible on the UART1, while the HSS is on the UART0

b) Programming eMMC memory (Host PC with Linux OS)
In order to program eMMC the board should be programmed with bitfile and HSS and the UARTs should be connected.
- connect the TySOM-M-MPFS250T (J5 mini USB connector) to the Host PC using micro USB cable.
- connect PMOD-UART board and start terminal on the UART0 (On the Linux OS it should be /dev/ttyXRUSB0)
- power up the board and wait for the HSS. When you see the message below, press a key to enter the HSS console.
```bash
[2.03609] HSS_MMCInit(): Attempting to select SDCARD ... [3.14030] mmc_init_common(): MSS_MMC_init() returned unexpected 0
Failed
[3.22537] HSS_MMCInit(): Attempting to select eMMC ... Passed
Press a key to enter CLI, ESC to skip
Timeout in 5 seconds
.....
```
- type usbdmsc command which should make the eMMC visible for the Host PC.
- check with dmesg command the label of the eMMC
```bash

```
and use it in the below command instead of **sdX**
```bash
zcat ./tmp-glibc/deploy/images/tysom-m-mpfs250t/mpfs-dev-cli-tysom-m-mpfs250t.wic.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4096 iflag=fullblock oflag=direct conv=fsync status=progress
```
- when the command is complete power off the board and power it on again. The Linux console should be visible on the UART1
