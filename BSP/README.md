## Introduction <a name="introduction"/>
TySOM-M-MPFS250T is Aldec board based on PolarFire SoC MPFS250T-ES, the first SoC FPGA with 64-bit RISC-V multi-core microprocessor subsystem. There are a few steps that needs to be done to boot Linux on the board:
1. Bitfile generation using Libero SoC with FPGA and microprocessor subsystem configuration.
This repository contains two microprocessor subsystem configurations in mss directory. One is for the design which uses eMMC memory, second is for the design which uses SD Card. In the designs/libero2021.1/reference_design directory there are files to generate two versions of reference design for TySOM-M-MPFS250T using Libero ( with eMMC and with SD Card ).
2. Building Hart Software Services baremetal application for TySOM-M-MPFS250T.
Aldec delivers a patch for official HSS repository which adds TySOM-M-MPFS250T support. HSS is the baremetal application which is zero stage boot loader (ZSBL) in this flow.
3. Linux OS
Aldec Yocto Project layer that needs to be added to the PolarFire SoC Yocto Project repository to build the Linux.

## Requirements <a name="requirements"/>

### Hardware <a name="requirements-hardware"/>

## Reference design <a name="reference-design"/>
The BSP package contains as well a set of [reference designs](https://github.com/aldec/TySOM-M-MPFS250T/tree/master/BSP/designs) which can be used by customers.

## Limitations <a name="limitations"/>
- USB Driver - The Microsemi Linux Device Driver for USB does not support the OTG mode. The USB works in the HOST mode when using Linux OS. The mini USB cable (with USB OD shorted to GND) must be plugged in before booting Linux, because the driver does not monitor the USB ID in runtime.

**WARNING: Connecting another USB device in Host mode when the USB VBUS voltage is provided can damage the FPGA and the board.**

- SPI Driver - Lack of Microsemi Linux Device Driver for PolarFire SPI controller.

- PolarFire SoC SPI Master programming mode using onboard memory is not supported on this release.

## Known problems and issues <a name="known-problems"/>
Below is the list of known problems and issues. The issues with (Microchip) label at the beginning are under investigation or development on the Microchip side.

Issue 1: The reboot Linux command cause the system crash.

Solution: Microchip recommends powering off/on the board instead of reboot command.

---

Issue 2: Programming the board via JTAG with bit file cause the Linux boot hangs after first run after the programming.

Solution: Microchip recommendation is to do power off/on the board after the programming.

---

Issue 3: The I2C Microchip Linux Device driver can cause hang of the I2C bus while communication with SI7055 temperature sensor.

Solution: The issue is under investigation. To restore I2C bus state the reboot is required.
